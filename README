This is very small nodeJS i made right after i saw it in a movie.
ideally it will text you every 24 days (should be configured to what you want) to see if your ok
if you are not able to respond by the second message it will send a server message and should text out any information you want!
maybe even tweet, really up to you :)
It uses the Twilio api to be able to send and receive sms messages, BUT
for it to work properly and handle responses the webserver does need to be hosted on the internet
- ngrok is what i used during testing -
and you public url of the nodeJS server needs to be added to called within your Twilio account.
